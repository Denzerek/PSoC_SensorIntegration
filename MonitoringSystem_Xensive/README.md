# PSoC6 based DPS3xx Monitoring System

## Brief

This is a demonstration of the New Haven 64x128 graphic LCD operation where a DPS3xx Pressure sensor data ( temperature
and pressure) is displayed with dynamic horizontal bar graph on the graphic LCD.

It also demonstrates the display of images like the Infineon LOGO in the case of this code example on the graphic LCD.
The images were converted to array format using the LCD assistant tool provided by New Haven
